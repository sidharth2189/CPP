/*
    The idea is to perform a copy or assignment similar to the default behavior, 
    i.e. copying the handle instead of the content (as with a shallow copy) while 
    at the same time keeping track of the number of instances that also point to 
    the same resource. Each time an instance goes out of scope, the counter is 
    decremented. Once the last object is about to be deleted, it can safely 
    deallocate the memory resource.
