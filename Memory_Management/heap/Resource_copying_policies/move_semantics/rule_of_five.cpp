/*
    The Rule of Five is especially important in resource management, where unnecessary 
    copying needs to be avoided due to limited resources and performance reasons. Also, 
    all the STL container classes such as std::vector implement the Rule of Five and use 
    move semantics for increased efficiency.

    The Rule of Five states that if you have to write one of the functions listed below 
    then you should consider implementing all of them with a proper resource management 
    policy in place. If you forget to implement one or more, the compiler will usually 
    generate the missing ones (without a warning) but the default versions might not be 
    suitable for the purpose you have in mind. The five functions are:

    The destructor: Responsible for freeing the resource once the object it belongs to 
    goes out of scope.

    The assignment operator: The default assignment operation performs a member-wise shallow 
    copy, which does not copy the content behind the resource handle. If a deep copy is needed, 
    it has be implemented by the programmer.

    The copy constructor: As with the assignment operator, the default copy constructor performs 
    a shallow copy of the data members. If something else is needed, the programmer has to implement 
    it accordingly.

    The move constructor: Because copying objects can be an expensive operation which involves creating, 
    copying and destroying temporary objects, rvalue references are used to bind to an rvalue. Using 
    this mechanism, the move constructor transfers the ownership of a resource from a (temporary) 
    rvalue object to a permanent lvalue object.

    The move assignment operator: With this operator, ownership of a resource can be transferred 
    from one object to another.

/*
    By looking at the stack addresses of the objects, we can see that the temporary object
    is moved using the move assignment operator, because the instance obj1
    is assigned an rvalue. As expected from an rvalue, its destructor is called immediately
    afterwards. But as it is made sure to null its data pointer in the move constructor, 
    the actual data will not be deleted. The advantage from a performance perspective in 
    this case is that no deep-copy of the rvalue object needs to be made, it is simply 
    redirecting the internal resource handle thus making an efficient shallow copy.

    Next, another temporary instance with a size of 1200 bytes is created as a temporary 
    object and "assigned" to obj3. Note that while the call looks like an assignment, 
    the move constructor is called under the hood, making the call identical to MyMovableClass 
    obj2(MyMovableClass(300));. By creating obj3 in such a way, we are reusing the temporary 
    rvalue and transferring ownership of its resources.
