Reasons for overloading new and delete
Now that we have seen how to overload the new and delete operators, let us summarize the major scenarios where it makes sense to do this:

The overloaded new operator function allows to add additional parameters. Therefore, a class can have multiple overloaded new operator functions. This gives the programmer more flexibility in customizing the memory allocation for objects.

Overloaded the new and delete operators provides an easy way to integrate a mechanism similar to garbage collection capabilities (such as in Java), as we will shorty see later in this course.

By adding exception handling capabilities into new and delete, the code can be made more robust.

It is very easy to add customized behavior, such as overwriting deallocated memory with zeros in order to increase the security of critical application data.
