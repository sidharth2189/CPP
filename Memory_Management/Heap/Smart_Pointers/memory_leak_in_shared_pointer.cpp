/*
    The circular reference lines produce a circular reference. 
    When myClass1 goes out of scope at the end of main, its 
    destructor canâ€™t clean up memory as there is still a 
    reference count of 1 in the smart pointer, which is 
    caused by the shared pointer _member in myClass2. 
    The same holds true for myClass2, which can not be 
    properly deleted as there is still a shared pointer 
    to it in myClass1. This deadlock situation prevents 
    the destructors from being called and causes a memory leak.
