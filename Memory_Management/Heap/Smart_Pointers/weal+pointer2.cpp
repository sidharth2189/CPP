/*
    As we have seen with raw pointers, you can never be sure wether the memory resource 
    to which the pointer refers is still valid. With a weak pointer, even though this 
    type does not prevent an object from being deleted, the validity of its resource can 
    be checked. The code below illustrates how to use the expired() function to do this.

    Thus, with smart pointers, there will always be a managing instance which is responsible 
    for the proper allocation and deallocation of a resource. In some cases it might be necessary 
    to convert from one smart pointer type to another.
