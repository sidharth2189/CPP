The benefits of smart pointers

To put it briefly: Smart pointers were introduced in C++ to solve the problems with new 
and delete operators by providing a degree of automatic memory management: When a smart 
pointer is no longer needed (which is the case as soon as it goes out of scope), the 
memory to which it points is automatically deallocated. When contrasted with smart 
pointers, the conventional pointers we have seen so far are often termed "raw pointers".

In essence, smart pointers are classes that are wrapped around raw pointers. By overloading 
the -> and * operators, smart pointer objects make sure that the memory to which their internal 
raw pointer refers to is properly deallocated. This makes it possible to use smart pointers 
with the same syntax as raw pointers. As soon as a smart pointer goes out of scope, its 
destructor is called and the block of memory to which the internal raw pointer refers is 
properly deallocated. This technique of wrapping a management class around a resource has 
been conceived by Bjarne Stroustroup and is called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).
