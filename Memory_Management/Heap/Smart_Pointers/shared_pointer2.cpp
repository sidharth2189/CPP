/*
    A shared pointer can also be redirected by using the reset() function. 
    If the resource which a shared pointer manages is no longer needed in 
    the current scope, the pointer can be reset to manage a difference resource

    After creation, the program prints 1 as the reference count of shared. Then, 
    the reset function is called with a new instance of MyClass as an argument. 
    This causes the destructor of the first MyClass instance to be called, hence
    the console output. As can be seen, the reference count of the shared pointer 
    is still at 1. Then, at the end of the program, the destructor of the second 
    MyClass object is called once the path of execution leaves the scope of main.
