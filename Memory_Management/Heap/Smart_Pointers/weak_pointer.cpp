/*
    Similar to shared pointers, there can be multiple weak pointers to the same resource. 
    The main difference though is that weak pointers do not increase the reference count. 
    Weak pointers hold a non-owning reference to an object that is managed by another shared pointer.

    The following rule applies to weak pointers: You can only create weak pointers out of shared 
    pointers or out of another weak pointer. 

    In code:
    First, a shared pointer to an integer is created with a reference count of 1 after creation. 
    Then, two weak pointers to the integer resource are created, the first directly from the 
    shared pointer and the second indirectly from the first weak pointer. As can be seen from 
    the output, neither of both weak pointers increased the reference count. At the end of main, 
    the attempt to directly create a weak pointer to an integer resource would lead to a compile error
