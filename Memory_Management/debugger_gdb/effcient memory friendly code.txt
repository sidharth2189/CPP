In algorithm design, programmers can exploit two principles to increase runtime performance:

Temporal locality means that address ranges that are accessed are likely to be used again in the near future. In the course of time, the same memory address is accessed relatively frequently (e.g. in a loop). This property can be used at all levels of the memory hierarchy to keep memory areas accessible as quickly as possible.

Spatial locality means that after an access to an address range, the next access to an address in the immediate vicinity is highly probable (e.g. in arrays). In the course of time, memory addresses that are very close to each other are accessed again multiple times. This can be exploited by moving the adjacent address areas upwards into the next hierarchy level during a memory access.
