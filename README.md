## CPP
The repository aims at demostrating various C++ topics through sample code.

* Foundations
   - [Introduction](/Fundamentals/) (store data, vectors, control loops, functions, read from file, formatting printed board)
   - [A*](/A_Star/) search (discrete path planning through an ASCII Keyboard)
   - [Multifiles](/Multi_file/) (header files, pointers (with various object types and with functions), build tools, maps and classes)

* [Object oriented approach](/class/) and [advanced concepts](/Advanced_OOP/)
   - Structures, Classes, members, constructors, initialization, encapsulation, access specifiers
   - Scope resolution, Accesor/Mutator functions, abstraction, private/static method
 
* [Modern memory management](/Memory_Management/)
   - Memory types (cache, virtual and structure of memory address)
   - Memory areas (heap and stack)
   - Dynamic memory allocation (heap)
   - Resource copying policy (Rule of 3, Rule of 5)
   - Smart pointers

* [Concurrency](/Concurrency/): Multi threads
   - Running threads (concurrent program running multiple threads)
   - passing data between threads
   - use mutexes and locks to safely access shared data from various threads
   - condition variable and message queues (implement a flexible message queue for flexible inter-thread communication)

* [Test Driven Development](/TDD/)
   - [Creating a binary tree with TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkdwtRAUIkE)
