# CPP
 C++ Projects

 1) Foundations
    - Introduction (store data, vectors, control loops, functions, read from file, formatting printed board)
    - A* search (path planning through an ASCII Keyboard)
    - Multifiles (header files, pointers (with various object types and with functions), build tools, maps and classes)

 2) Object oriented approach
    - Structures, Classes, members, constructors, initialization, encapsulation, access specifiers
    - Scope resolution, Accesor/Mutator functions, abstraction, private/static method
 
 3) Modern memory management
    - Memory types (cache, virtual and structure of memory address)
    - Memory areas (heap and stack)
    - Dynamic memory allocation (heap)
    - Resource copying policy (Rule of 3, Rule of 5)
    - Smart pointers

 4) Concurrency: Multi threads
    - Running threads (concurrent program running multiple threads)
    - passing data between threads
    - use mutexes and locks to safely access shared data from various threads
    - condition variable and message queues (implement a flexible message queue for flexible inter-thread communication)
