/*
    Starting Threads with Lambdas:
    A Lambda is an object and, like other objects it may be copied, passed as a parameter, 
    stored in a container, etc. The Lambda object has its own scope and lifetime which may, 
    in some circumstances, be different to those objects it has ‘captured’. Programers need 
    to take special care when capturing local objects by reference because a Lambda’s lifetime 
    may exceed the lifetime of its capture list: It must be ensured that the object to which 
    the reference points is still in scope when the Lambda is called. This is especially 
    important in multi-threading programs.

    The output in the main thread is generated first, at which point the variable ID has taken 
    the value 1. Then, the call-by-value thread is executed with ID at a value of 0. Then, the 
    call-by-reference thread is executed with ID at a value of 1. This illustrates the effect 
    of passing a value by reference : when the data to which the reference refers changes before 
    the thread is executed, those changes will be visible to the thread. Such behavior later is 
    a primary source of concurrency bugs.
