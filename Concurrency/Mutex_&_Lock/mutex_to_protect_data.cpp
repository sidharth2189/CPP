/*
    Using mutex to protect data
    In its simplest form, using a mutex consists of four straight-forward steps:

    1-Include the <mutex> header
    2-Create an std::mutex
    3-Lock the mutex using lock() before read/write is called
    4-Unlock the mutex after the read/write operation is finished using unlock()
    
    In order to protect the access to _vehicles from being manipulated by several 
    threads at once, a mutex has been added to the class as a private data member. 
    In the pushBack function, the mutex is locked before a new element is added to 
    the vector and unlocked after the operation is complete.

    Note that the mutex is also locked in the function printSize just before printing 
    the size of the vector. The reason for this lock is two-fold: First, we want to 
    prevent a data race that would occur when a read-access to the vector and a 
    simultaneous write access (even when under the lock) would occur. And second, 
    we want to exclusively reserve the standard output to the console for printing 
    the vector size without other threads printing to it at the same time.

    When this code is executed, 1000 elements will be in the vector. By using a mutex 
    to our shared resource, a data race has been effectively avoided.
