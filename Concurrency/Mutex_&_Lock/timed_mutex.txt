Using timed_mutex
In the following, a short overview of the different available mutex types is given:

mutex: provides the core functions lock() and unlock() and the non-blocking try_lock() 
method that returns if the mutex is not available.
recursive_mutex: allows multiple acquisitions of the mutex from the same thread.
timed_mutex: similar to mutex, but it comes with two more methods try_lock_for() and 
try_lock_until() that try to acquire the mutex for a period of time or until a moment 
in time is reached.
recursive_timed_mutex: is a combination of timed_mutex and recursive_mutex.
