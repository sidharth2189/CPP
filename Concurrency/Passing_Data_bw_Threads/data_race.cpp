/*
    Passing data to a thread by value
    In the following example, an instance of the proprietary class Vehicle is 
    created and passed to a thread by value, thus making a copy of it.

    Note that the class Vehicle has a default constructor and an initializing 
    constructor. In the main function, when the instances v0 and v1 are created, 
    each constructor is called respectively. Note that v0 is passed by value to 
    a Lambda, which serves as the thread function for std::async. Within the Lambda, 
    the id of the Vehicle object is changed from the default (which is 0) to a new 
    value 2. Note that the thread execution is paused for 500 milliseconds to 
    guarantee that the change is performed well after the main thread has proceeded 
    with its execution.

    In the main thread, immediately after starting up the worker thread, the id of 
    v0 is changed to 3. Then, after waiting for the completion of the thread, the 
    vehicle id is printed to the console. In this program, the output will always 
    be the following:

    Passing data to a thread in this way is a clean and safe method as there is no 
    danger of a data race - at least when atomic data types such as integers,
