/*
    When passing a complex data structure however, there are sometimes pointer 
    variables hidden within, that point to a (potentially) shared data buffer - 
    which might cause a data race even though the programmer believes that the 
    copied data will effectively preempt this. The next example illustrates 
    this case by adding a new member variable to the Vehicle class, which is 
    a pointer to a string object, as well as the corresponding getter and 
    setter functions.

    The output of the program looks like this:

    The basic program structure is mostly identical to the previous example 
    with the object v0 being copied by value when passed to the thread function. 
    This time however, even though a copy has been made, the original object 
    v0 is modified, when the thread function sets the new name. This happens 
    because the member _name is a pointer to a string and after copying, even 
    though the pointer variable has been duplicated, it still points to the 
    same location as its value (i.e. the memory location) has not changed. 
    Note that when the delay is removed in the thread function, the console
     output varies between "Vehicle 2" and "Vehicle 3", depending on the 
     system scheduler. Such an error might go unnoticed for a long time. 
     It could show itself well after a program has been shipped to the 
     client - which is what makes this error type so treacherous.

    Classes from the standard template library usually implement a deep copy 
    behavior by default (such as std::vector). When dealing with proprietary 
    data types, this is not guaranteed. The only safe way to tell whether a 
    data structure can be safely passed is by looking at its implementation:
    Does it contain only atomic data types or are there pointers somewhere? 
    If this is the case, does the data structure implement the copy constructor 
    (and the assignment operator) correctly? Also, if the data structure under 
    scrutiny contains sub-objects, their respective implementation has to be 
    analyzed as well to ensure that deep copies are made everywhere.

    Unfortunately, one of the primary concepts of object-oriented programming - 
    information hiding - often prevents us from looking at the implementation 
    details of a class - we can only see the interface, which does not tell us 
    what we need to know
