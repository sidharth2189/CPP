/*
    Passing exceptions
    The future-promise communication channel may also be used for passing exceptions. 
    To do this, the worker thread simply sets an exception rather than a value in the promise. 
    In the parent thread, the exception is then re-thrown once get() is called on the future.

    Let us take a look at the following example to see how this mechanism works:

    In the thread function, we need to implement a try-catch block which can be set to 
    catch a particular exception or - as in our case - to catch all exceptions. Instead 
    of setting a value, we now want to throw a std::exception along with a customized 
    error message. In the catch-block, we catch this exception and throw it to the parent 
    thread using the promise with set_exception. The function std::current_exception allows 
    us to easily retrieve the exception which has been thrown.

    On the parent side, we now need to catch this exception. In order to do this, we can 
    use a try-block around the call to get(). We can set the catch-block to catch all 
    exceptions or - as in this example - we could also catch a particular one such as 
    the standard exception. Calling the method what() on the exception allows us to 
    retrieve the message from the exception - which is the one defined on the promise 
    side of the communication channel.

    When we run the program, we can see that the exception is being thrown in the worker 
    thread with the main thread printing the corresponding error message to the console.

    So a promise future pair can be used to pass either values or exceptions between threads.
