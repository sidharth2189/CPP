/*
    The function object is copied into internal storage accessible to the new thread, 
    and the new thread invokes the operator (). The Vehicle class can of course have 
    data members and other member functions too, and this is one way of passing data 
    to the thread function: pass it in as a constructor argument and store it as a 
    data member

    The class Vehicle has a constructor that takes an integer and it will store it 
    internally in a variable _id. In the overloaded function call operator, the 
    vehicle id is printed to the console. In main(), we are creating the Vehicle 
    object using copy initialization.
