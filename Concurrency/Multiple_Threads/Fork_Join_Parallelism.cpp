/*
    Running Multiple Threads
    Fork-Join Parallelism
    Using threads follows a basic concept called "fork-join-parallelism". The basic mechanism of this 
    concept follows a simple three-step pattern:

    Split the flow of execution into a parallel thread ("fork")
    Perform some work in both the main thread and the parallel thread
    Wait for the parallel thread to finish and unite the split flow of execution again ("join")
    The following diagram "fork_join_parallelism.jpg" in the folder illustrates the idea of forking.

    In the main thread, the program flow is forked into three parallel branches. In both worker 
    branches, some work is performed - which is why threads are often referred to as "worker 
    threads". Once the work is completed, the flow of execution is united again in the main 
    function using the join() command. In code below, join acts as a barrier where all 
    threads are united. The execution of main is in fact halted, until both worker threads 
    have succesfully executed.

    In the following code, a number of threads is created and added to a vector. The basic idea 
    is to loop over the vector at the end of the main function and call join on all the thread 
    objects inside the vector.

    When we try to compile the program using the push_back() function (which is the usual way in 
    most cases), we get a compiler error. The problem with our code is that by pushing the thread 
    object into the vector, we attempt to make a copy of it. However, thread objects do not have 
    a copy constructor and thus can not be duplicated. If this were possible, we would create yet 
    another branch in the flow of execution - which is not what we want. The solution to this problem 
    is to use move semantics, which provide a convenient way for the contents of objects to be 'moved' 
    between objects, rather than copied.

    To solve our problem, we can use the function emplace_back() instead of push_back(), which 
    internally uses move semantics to move our thread object into the vector without making a 
    copy. 

    When we take a close look at the call to std::cout in the thread function, we can see that it actually 
    consists of three parts: the string "Hello from workerâ€¦", the respective thread id and finally the line 
    break at the end. In the output, all three components are completely intermingled. Also, when the program 
    is run several times, the output will look different with each execution. This shows us two important 
    properties of concurrent programs:

    1-The order in which threads are executed is non-deterministic. Every time a program is executed, 
    there is a chance for a completely different order of execution.

    2-Threads may get preempted in the middle of execution and another thread may be selected to run.

    These two properties pose a major problem with concurrent applications: A program may run correctly 
    for thousands of times and suddenly, due to a particular interleaving of threads, there might be a 
    problem. From a debugging perspective, such errors are very hard to detect.
