/*
    One very important trait of concurrent programs is their non-deterministic behavior. 
    It can not be predicted which thread the scheduler will execute at which point in time. 
    In the code on the right, the amount of work to be performed both in the thread function 
    and in main has been split into two separate jobs.

    The console output shows that the work packages in both threads have been interleaved with 
    the first package being performed before the second package.

    Executing the code several times more shows that the two versions of program output interchange 
    in a seemingly random manner. This element of randomness is an important characteristic of concurrent 
    programs and we have to take measures to deal with it in a controlled way that prevent unwanted 
    behavior or even program crashes.
