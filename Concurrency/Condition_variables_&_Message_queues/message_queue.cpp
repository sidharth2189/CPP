/*
    Implementing the WaitingVehicles queue
    Now that we have all the ingredients to implement the concurrent queue to store waiting 
    Vehicle objects, let us start with the implementation according to the diagram above.

    The first step is to add a condition variable to WaitingVehicles class as a private member 
    - just as the mutex.

    The next step is to notify the client after pushing a new Vehicle into the vector.

    In the method popBack, we need to create the lock first - it can not be a lock_guard 
    any more as we need to pass it to the condition variable - to its method wait. Thus 
    it must be a unique_lock. Now we can enter the wait state while at same time releasing 
    the lock. It is only inside wait, that the mutex is temporarily unlocked - which is a 
    very important point to remember: We are holding the lock before AND after our call to 
    wait - which means that we are free to access whatever data is protected by the mutex. 
    In our example, this will be dataIsAvailable().

    Before we continue, we need to discuss the problem of "spurious wake-ups": Once in a 
    while, the system will - for no obvious reason - wake up a thread. If such a spurious 
    wake-up happened with taking proper precautions, we would issue wait without new data 
    being available (because the wake-up has not been caused by the condition variable but 
    by the system in this case). To prevent the call to wait in this case, we have to modify 
    the code slightly:
    In this code, even after a spurious wake-up, we are now checking wether data really is 
    available. If so, we would be issuing the call to wait on the condition variable. And 
    only if we are inside wait, may other threads modify and access dataIsAvailable.

    If the vector is empty, wait is called. When the thread wakes up again, the condition is 
    immediately re-checked and - in case it has not been a spurious wake-up we can continue 
    with our job and retrieve the vector.

    We can further simplify this code by letting the wait() function do the testing as well 
    as the looping for us. Instead of the while loop, we can just pass a Lambda to wait(), 
    which repeatedly checks wether the vector contains elements (thus the inverted logical 
    expression):

    Image

    (continued) When wait() finishes, we are guaranteed to find a new element in the vector 
    this time. Also, we are still holding the lock and thus no other thread is able to access 
    the vector - so there is no danger of a data race in this situation. As soon as we are 
    out of scope, the lock will be automatically released.

    In the main() function, there is still the polling loop that infinitely queries the 
    availability of new Vehicle objects. But contrary to the example before, a call to 
    popBack now puts the main() thread into a wait state and only resumes when new data 
    is available - thus significantly reducing the load to the processor.
