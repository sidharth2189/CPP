From within the build directory, you can now run CMake as follows:


root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/cmake_example/build# cmake ..
root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/cmake_example/build# make
The first line directs the cmake command at the top-level CMakeLists.txt file with ... This command uses the CMakeLists.txt to configure the project and create a Makefile in the build directory.

In the second line, make finds the Makefile and uses the instructions in the Makefile to build the project.
